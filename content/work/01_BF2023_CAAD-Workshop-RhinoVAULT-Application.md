### Introduction
This workshop introduces the role of digital technology in contemporary architecture, focusing on the development and application of CAD/CAM tools, vibrating knife systems, and CNC technology. Participants will first explore the theoretical foundations, including how these tools transform the architectural design process. They will then gain hands-on experience, from CAD-based part design to operating vibrating knife and CNC machines for model making, working in groups to create small-scale structural prototypes. Finally, the workshop examines real-world cases, current challenges, and future trends, encouraging innovative thinking, critical discussion, and strategies for integrating digital fabrication technologies into architectural practice.
