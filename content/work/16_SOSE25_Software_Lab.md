### Introduction
Analyzing IFC models provides valuable insights into design processes and supports the development of intelligent model evaluation frameworks. We employ **IfcOpenShell** to extract **geometric**, **attribute**, **topological**, and **relational features** from IFC data. Building on the original scope of IFC model analysis, our study constructs a dataset of more than 300 IFC models, which are used to train and evaluate predictive frameworks. We focus on selected attributes (e.g., **U-Value**, **FireRating**, **IsExternal**) and compare prediction tasks across different value types (**Boolean**, **numeric**, **categorical**). To achieve robust performance, we adopt an ensemble learning strategy that integrates **rule-based systems**, **traditional machine learning**, and **deep learning** models. This multi-model approach enables us to assess model-specific strengths, improve semantic inference of IFC attributes, and establish a comprehensive evaluation of prediction accuracy across heterogeneous property types.
