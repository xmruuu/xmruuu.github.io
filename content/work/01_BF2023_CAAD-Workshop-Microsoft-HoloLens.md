### Introduction

In the “HoloLens Glasses Workshop,” we explore the integration of VR technology in construction and design using HoloLens glasses. The workshop offers a hands-on introduction to the HoloLens, showcasing how they transform design and construction processes.

Participants will engage in interactive exercises, experiencing firsthand how VR aids in visualizing architectural designs and enhances project planning in construction. Through practical demonstrations and real-world examples, attendees will see the potential of VR technology in improving accuracy and facilitating collaboration.

This workshop is an exciting opportunity to understand and experience the future of VR in design and construction, leaving participants inspired to integrate these innovative solutions in their professional practices.
