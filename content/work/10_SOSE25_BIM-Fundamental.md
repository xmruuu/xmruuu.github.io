### Introduction
This project was part of the **SS25 BIM Fundamental Course**, aimed at developing a deeper understanding of the potential of **Building Information Modeling (BIM)** and the structure of the **IFC schema**. The assignment required us to create a semantically enriched and detailed BIM model, acting simultaneously as designers and engineers. We carefully examined the structure, appearance, and material definitions of the model, ensuring semantic accuracy and consistency throughout. This process not only strengthened our modeling skills but also provided us with a solid foundation in comprehending the logic and framework of IFC-based data representation.
