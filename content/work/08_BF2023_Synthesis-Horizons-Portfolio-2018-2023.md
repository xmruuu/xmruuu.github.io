### Introduction
In Taiwan, a land brimming with vitality and diversity, my portfolio transcends the boundaries between architectural practice and computational design, profoundly reflecting a deep exploration of the local environment and societal contexts. Leveraging technology, I transform complex data into refined design philosophies, allowing a precise dialogue between algorithmic accuracy and natural harmony, guiding the architectural field towards innovation.

My designs strive to balance the insights of Geographic Information Systems, the analysis of social behavior patterns, and the precision of algorithms. Through meticulous digital tools and thoughtful methodologies, a new architectural language emerges, one that converses with Taiwan's rich socio-cultural tapestry and natural surroundings while respecting and enhancing the local spirit.

My journey is marked by a spirit of innovation and a profound love for the land. At the intersection of contemporary pulses, this portfolio not only records my personal efforts in design practice but also reflects an architect's vision: Through the fusion of innovation and digital technology, to continuously explore and realize more resilient and intelligent living environments.
