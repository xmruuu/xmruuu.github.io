### Introduction
This course was carried out in collaboration with [XR HUB Bavaria](https://xrhub-bavaria.de/), focusing on the production of an animation themed around **future energy**. The final work was showcased in the dome theater at [1E9 & Festival der Zukunft](https://www.1e9.community/festival-der-zukunft/2025/deutsch). Our team selected the **Dyson Swarm** as the central concept, and most of the modeling was accomplished using **Blender**, where we made extensive use of parametric node systems to generate environments and handle complex geometries. Producing an animation tailored for a spherical dome theater was a unique challenge, and we are proud to have successfully completed it and received applause from the audience at the conclusion of the event.
