### Introduction
I developed a complete **IFC-to-graph structure pipeline**, leveraging **IfcOpenShell** for data extraction and **D3.js** for visualization. The system unfolds each hierarchical level of an IFC model and maps its attributes and values into an **interactive graph**, enabling intuitive exploration of complex building projects. This represents the first step toward decomposing and understanding architectural data. Future plans include integrating **LLMs (e.g., LangGraph)** for semantic interpretation and extending the framework to support refined analyses of physical environments, structural properties, and topological relationships. Establishing **semantic modeling** as the foundation is essential for enabling computers and machines to read building information clearly and accurately, I am continuously exploring.
