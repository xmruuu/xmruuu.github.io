It’s been a year since I started the Information Technologies for the Built Environment (ITBE) program at TUM, and looking back now, I can hardly believe how much I’ve grown.

When I first joined, I was basically a beginner, my only “programming” experience was using Grasshopper. I had never really written code. Fast forward a year, and things feel so different: I’ve gone from a visual-programming-only newbie to someone who can actually code, analyze data, and build systems. It’s been challenging, but also incredibly rewarding.

What makes ITBE so special is how it’s structured. The program isn’t just about one field, it’s like three worlds blending together:

**Architectural Informatics** + **Geoinformatics** + **Computation in Civil Engineering** 

Together, these modules form a unique ecosystem for exploring the future of the built environment. And the best part is, I feel like I’m learning right at the frontier, alongside researchers and scholars who are shaping what’s next for our field.

Looking back, this journey has been more than just an academic experience—it’s been about shifting how I think, how I solve problems, and how I imagine the role of technology in construction and design. And honestly, I can’t wait to see what the next chapter brings.
