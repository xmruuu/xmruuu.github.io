I recently joined a Code Jam interview at mod.construction, which felt more like a fun three-hour mini hackathon than a typical test. The challenge was to create a graph structure that an LLM could understand, but this time the hierarchy was built on topology instead of the usual ways I’ve worked with before. There were just three of us participating, which made the whole thing feel collaborative and engaging. To top it off, I was really excited to receive an offer afterward.

For me, the biggest takeaway wasn’t about coding itself but about mindset. Staying calm, breaking problems down step by step, and keeping my logic clear turned out to be way more useful than chasing one “perfect” solution.

I also really enjoyed working with the team. Sharing ideas, listening to each other, and combining different perspectives helped us find solutions much faster than going solo. Even when we hit tough spots, trying things out, adjusting, and keeping the teamwork going made the experience rewarding.

In the end, this Code Jam felt less like a competition and more like a good reminder: problem-solving is about mindset, clarity, and teamwork. I’m looking forward to learning more and growing with the team at mod.construction.
