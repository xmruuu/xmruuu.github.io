The challenge was to create a graph structure that an LLM could understand, but this time the hierarchy was built on topology instead of the usual ways I’ve worked with before. There were just three of us participating, which made the whole thing feel collaborative and engaging. To top it off, I was really excited to receive an offer afterward.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Learning Journey in ITBE – One Year Later</title><link>https://xmruuu.github.io/blog/2025-08-10/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://xmruuu.github.io/blog/2025-08-10/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://xmruuu.github.io/img/Blog/ITBE/group_pic.webp" alt="ITBE Group Photo" class="max-w-full h-auto cursor-pointer hover:opacity-90 transition-opacity" loading="lazy" onclick="openLightbox('\/img\/Blog\/ITBE\/group_pic.webp', 'ITBE Group Photo')"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a year since I started the Information Technologies for the Built Environment (ITBE) program at TUM, and looking back now, I can hardly believe how much I’ve grown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first joined, I was basically a beginner, my only “programming” experience was using Grasshopper. I had never really written code. Fast forward a year, and things feel so different: I’ve gone from a visual-programming-only newbie to someone who can actually code, analyze data, and build systems. It’s been challenging, but also incredibly rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
